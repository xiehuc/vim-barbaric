⌨️  Barbaric
==========

**vim + non-Latin input = pain.** _Barbaric_ is the cure.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlue/i/master/vim-barbaric/demo.gif)

### Why?

Normal mode mappings (_e.g.,_ `h` / `j` / `k` / `l`) are all 8-bit ASCII characters. That means that when you want to work on a file in Russian (or Greek or Chinese), you’ve got to switch back to English (or Spanish or German) every time you leave Insert mode.

_Barbaric_ detects which input method is active when you first launch vim, then again any time you leave Input mode, and switches between them for you automatically.

### No, I mean why ‘Barbaric’?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Barbarian&oldid=792816841) (emphasis mine):

> The Greeks used the term _barbarian_ for all non-Greek-speaking peoples,
> including the Egyptians, Persians, Medes and Phoenicians, emphasizing their
> otherness, because the language they spoke sounded to Greeks like gibberish
> represented by the sounds “bar bar bar”....
> 
> The Romans adapted the term **to refer to anything non-Roman**.

Vim doesn’t play nicely with non-Latin scripts; _i.e.,_ input languages of non-Roman origin. _Ipso facto,_ this is a plugin for barbarians.

### Supported Platforms

macOS only. For other platforms, consider:

* built-in support for X11 and MS-Windows IMEs (`:help mbyte-XIM` / `:help mbyte-IME`),
* built-in multi-byte keymaps (`:help mbyte-keymap` / explained [here](https://github.com/rlue/vim-barbaric/issues/2#issuecomment-344625562)), or
* [vim-xkbswitch](https://github.com/lyokha/vim-xkbswitch).

Installation
------------

There are lots of vim plugin managers out there. I like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

### Dependencies

* **[xkbswitch-macosx](https://github.com/myshov/xkbswitch-macosx)**

  To install, copy the binary to one of the folders on your `PATH`:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/myshov/xkbswitch-macosx
  $ cp xkbswitch-macosx/bin/xkbswitch /usr/local/bin
  $ rm -rf xkbswitch-macosx
  ```

  (It’s not ideal — I wish there were a brew formula. If you do too, let [@myshov](https://github.com/myshov) know [here](https://github.com/myshov/xkbswitch-macosx/issues/4).)

Usage
-----

_Barbaric_ should work out of the box provided that whenever you launch vim, the active input method is the same one you want to use in Normal mode. If that’s not the case, be sure to set the first option in the [configuration section](#configuration) below.

#### Known bugs

On certain input methods (notably Chinese and Korean), switching windows away from vim and back can cause xkbswitch to malfunction. The problem is described [here](https://github.com/myshov/xkbswitch-macosx/issues/5).

Configuration
-------------

To change the default behavior of _Barbaric_, modify the lines below and add them to your `.vimrc`. 

```viml
" The input method for Normal mode (as defined by `xkbswitch -g`)
let g:barbaric_default_name = 'ABC' "much stable
let g:barbaric_default = 0

" The scope where alternate input methods persist (buffer, window, tab, global)
let g:barbaric_scope = 'buffer'

" Forget alternate input method after n seconds in Normal mode (disabled by default)
" Useful if you only need IM persistence for short bursts of active work.
let g:barbaric_timeout = -1
```
